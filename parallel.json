    "transcript": "buffets are usually known for serving\ncheap lowquality foods that might give\nyou food poisoning however I recently\ndiscovered luxury buffets exist these\nrestaurants serve Fresh highquality\nFoods have hundreds of options to choose\nfrom and they're supposed to be one of\nthe best food experiences you can get\nbut they come at a hefty price which is\nwhy I've made it my mission to eat at\nsome of the most expensive and luxurious\nbuffets to see if their food is actually\ngood or if they're still just complete\nripoffs so I packed my bags and began my\njourney in Vegas behind me is a circus\ncircus home to the Circus buffet the\nfirst out of four buffets I'll be\nvisiting it's actually the most\naffordable one in all of Vegas so I'm\nhoping that it's actually worth the\nmoney let's go\n[Music]\ninside good morning uh just for one got\nit thank\nyou awesome perfect thank you appreciate\nit so I just got seated and first\nimpressions yall this Buffet is very\nempty compared to what you'd expect to\nsee in Vegas with that being said I plan\non judging each of these buffets based\non three things the most expensive food\nitem the most popular food and of course\nthe desserts let's go check out the\nbuffet stations so a typical Buffet\nusually has a bunch of different\nstations with tons of food to choose\nfrom which is why I was very surprised\nto see only one breakfast station\nliterally every other food station at\nthis buffet was completely this is very\ndisappointing but I got in line anyways\nlooked through the food options and\nunfortunately didn't see anything that\nlooked even remotely expensive if I were\nto guess I'm assuming the eggs are the\nmost expensive thing here since eggs are\nlike $8 a carton now or something I\ndon't know I got some food then noticed\na huge line of people waiting for what\nappears to be I'm assuming these are\nvery tasty Because by the time it was my\nturn they ran out so I had to wait 10\nminutes while they restocked so\nobviously the food uh doesn't look great\nI didn't get that much either because\nhonestly I don't really want to eat it\nthis might be a little gross but while I\nwas walking around I couldn't help but\nnotice how dirty this Buffet is it is\nrated 1.9 stars on Yelp though so I\nguess that checks out but I'm still here\nto give this place an honest review so\nlet's try these expensive\n[Music]\neggs okay y'all I I promise I don't want\nto be dramatic but these are the worst\neggs I think I've ever had in my life I\ndon't know how to explain this but the\neggs are just like so grainy and gritty\nthese are not fluffy and there's zero\nflavor\nhonestly I feel really bad saying all of\nthis let's go ahead and try these\npancakes these seem really popular so\nhow bad could they be these are so\ndry I don't understand how they mess\nthat one up I think it's safe to say so\nfar this has not been a great experience\nsadly the last thing on my plate was\nalso pretty bad I was not expecting a\nlot out of this Buffet I just did not\nexpect it to be this terrible especially\nbecause it's on the Vegas Strip for\ncontext the modern buffet was invented\nin Vegas in 1946 at the El Rancho Casino\nits main purpose was to keep gamblers in\nthe casino for as long as possible with\nthat in mind if I were the owner of this\nBuffet you'd think I'd make it at least\nsomewhat decent to keep gamblers\ngambling but guess not now even though\nuh I'm very disappointed I still have\nplenty of room for desserts if I can get\na good dessert from this Buffet maybe I\ncan justify it costing 20 $25\nwe'll see though I got up to get myself\na little sweet treat but I soon\ndiscovered the ice cream machines are\nnot working so there's no dessert yeah\nso I had to leave that buffet was awful\nluckily that was the cheapest buffet of\nthis entire video and every Buffet after\nthis gets way more expensive I love your\nvideos bro oh dude I didn't think you\ngoing to be in Vegas why are you in\nCircus Circus I'm doing a buffet video\noh a buffet video bro\nno it was nice meeting you bro so that\ninteraction basically proved my point uh\nso I guess there's only one thing left\nto answer was the circus Buffet worth\nthe\n[Music]\n$20 I made it to\nParis just kidding I'm actually in front\nof the\nbagio known for having some of the most\npopular tourist attractions the bagio is\narguably the most famous Casino and\nResort in Vegas it's also the home of\nthe buffet at Bellagio yeah creative\nname I know now since this Buffet is\ninside such an iconic Hotel I'm\nexpecting very good things my\nreservation isn't for another 45 minutes\nso before I go inside your boy's going\nto do some exploring and uh check out\nthe other cool stuff they got around\nhere of course I had to do what all\ntourists do and check out the famous\nbagio fountain\nshow nice then I went inside to visit\nthe Bellagio Conservatory to see their\nbeautiful garden attraction holy cow\nthis is crazy apparently this Garden\ncost the resort between $500,000 to a\nmillion every season to redesign as\ny'all can see it's currently fairy\nthemed so my girlfriend is so obsessed\nwith fairies and fantasy books to the\npoint where she's literally starting\nlike a book Channel soon she would love\nit here but unfortunately I did not\nbring her along for this trip Carrie if\nyou're watching this please don't be\njealous and mad at me thanks after\nspending a few more minutes admiring the\ngarden display it was finally time for\nme to make my way to the buffet\nhello oh yeah just for one perfect thank\nyou appreciate it I've officially made\nit to my seat first impressions of the\nbagio buffet compared to the Circus\nCircus buffet is that this Buffet is way\nbigger probably like three times the\nsize of the one at Circus Circus one\nissue I do have with this Buffet so far\nthough is I have to go get my own water\nkeep in mind that this Buffet is $55 to\n$60 a person I don't want to spend too\nmuch time complaining though so let's do\na real Buffet tour they literally St me\nso far away from all of the food it it's\na long walk just to just to get to the\nbuffet stations first up we have the\njuice bar a Pancake Station Pizza\nStation an entire area dedicated to\nrotisseries the meats a seafood station\nthe Far East station no comment on this\none there's a fresh fruit station and\nthere's even an entire area dedicated to\ndesserts this is what a buffet should be\nnow right off the bat I know that the\nbagio buffet is famous for their crab\nlegs so I got to see how good they are\ngrab a plate but weirdly enough after\nlooking around the seafood station I'm\nnot seeing any crab at all whatsoever oh\nexcuse me where are the crab legs we\nhave crab leg oh another question what\ndo you think the most popular like food\nis here I love so the meats are the most\npopular yeah okay got it awesome thank\nyou I appreciate it well I wish I knew\nthe crab legs were only start on\nSaturdays cuz I would have made my\nreservation for then but now we got to\nchange things up on the fly all right\nPrime Ribbit is where is that now\nI asked the meat station guide to carve\nout a slice of the prime rib and\nhonestly it looks pretty good I just\nhope it's good enough to be worth the\ncost of this Buffet thank you you're\nwelcome quick question what do you think\nthe most expensive thing youall have at\nthe buffet is yeah usually it would be a\nc but I would say prim okay so this is\nthe most expensive and the most popular\nthing here on Fridays okay cool thank\nyou appreciate it I also got some\nroasted veggies Oysters Rockefeller some\nscrambled eggs don't judge me there's a\nreason for it behold my first plates of\nreal buffet food now even though this\ndoes look better than the food from the\nCircus buffet I was very disappointed to\nfind out that even for $55 per person\nthey don't sell crab legs on Fridays why\nis it $55 then this isn't $55 to be\nhonest I could be a little hangry since\nI didn't eat much this morning so I'm\njust going to shut up dry the food and\nif it's good then my mood will get\nbetter I tried the eggs first and listen\nI just wanted to compare them to the\neggs from Circus buffet and thankfully\nthese eggs are immensely better then I\ntried the Oysters\nRockefeller I am normally a very big fan\nof raw oysters but these oysters\nRockefeller or whatever this was nasty\nit's got like a pungent fishy aftertaste\nnot a fan that was very unexpected and\nwith only one thing left on my plate\nhopefully this prime rib does not\ndisappoint now all of you meat lovers\nout there you will probably notice this\nlooks a little\novercooked oh dude no that is so dry\nlooking okay here we go oh God cheers\nthis clip is sped up and I was still\nchewing on this one bite\n[Music]\nforever I didn't even take that big of a\nbite it's so dry I don't know how to\nproperly describe how terrible this\nprime rib is I was chewing forever it is\nabsolutely no flavor and and it's\nsupposed to be the most expensive and\npopular thing here who else is getting\nthis I went ahead and got another plate\nbecause I refuse to leave this Buffet\nstill hungry after spending over $55\nthis time we got barbecue pork rib\nvegetable l Main a barbecue pork bun and\nstuffing my only expectations this time\naround was for the food to be a little\nbit better than the prime rib so let's\nstart with the good news basically\neverything on my plate right now was\nindeed better than the prime rib\nhowever overall it was still pretty\nmediocre the low main was super greasy\neverything just kind of lacked flavor\nand my mom would probably disown me if I\nmade her eat these pork buns so yeah I'm\nvery disappointed right now because\nhonestly I expected so much more I don't\neven know if I can rank this above the\nCircus buffet even though there were\nmore options and the food was you know\nkind of higher quality I guess it's\noverd double the price and the food\ntastes just as bad the only saving grace\nfor this Buffet is that they actually\nhad pretty decent\ndessert so I've officially finished my\nmeal at the Bellagio buffet and if I\nwere to describe it with just three\nwords those three words would be not\nworth it I'm still mad about the crab\nlegs I literally sat down at this slot\nmachine debating to gamble and try to\nwin my money back but I'm not going to\ndo that because if I lose that is how\nthe Cino wins or maybe Vegas is already\nwinning because so far I've wasted a lot\nof money all right all right y'all it's\na little late but behind me is the win\nHotel home of the buffet at win which\nmany have dubbed the most beautiful\nbuffet in Vegas I have a reservation for\nlunch there tomorrow which means tonight\nI'm actually going to be staying at the\nwind hotel which I heard is like one of\nthe top three best hotels in Vegas so I\nam very excited to check it out I've\nnever stayed here before I'm also really\nsleepy so let's go inside upon walking\nthrough the front doors I was\nimmediately in in awe this is without a\ndoubt the nicest hotel entrance I've\nseen in my life why is there a carousel\nthat you cannot ride I don't understand\nthis nice man named massu offered to\ntake a video of me with the carousel\nthanks appreciate it take more from here\nsure here's here's\ngood cool thanks man then I made my way\nthrough the rest of the casino towards\nthe front desk to check in and somehow\nalso got upgraded to a fancy room we\nmade it floor 55 I don't know what to\nexpect right now this is literally the\nnicest hotel I've ever stayed at so at\nthis point I'm just assuming the room is\ngoing to be\n[Music]\namazing what this room is gorgeous time\nfor bed\ngood morning let's go eat at a buffet I\ngot dressed and put on a nice shirt for\nthis very fancy\nBuffet then I left my room made my way\nthrough the casino and officially\narrived at the wind\nBuffet this Buffet is very fancy I am a\nlittle nervous though since we're off to\na pretty bad start with fancy expensive\nbuffets I just hope they spent as much\nmoney on the food here as they did on\ndecorating the place let's go check in\nuh I reservation under uh Dylan uh win\nfor one give us one mom we'll get you\ngot you no rush thank you appreciate it\nafter waiting just a few minutes I was\nescorted to my seat and on the way there\nI instantly understood why this\nrestaurant is considered the most\nbeautiful buffet in Vegas so I think\nit's already very obvious this place\ndestroys the buffet at the Bellagio I\ncan't believe how fancy this place is\nlet's go check out these Buffet stations\nwe got a seafood station Chinese food\nthe meats a station for Mexican food a\nPizza Bar deli meats and shuder fresh\nfruits and this gigantic island in the\nmiddle of the buffet dedicated to\nbeautiful desserts yeah y'all Decor\naside even the food here feels different\nthan the Bellagio this doesn't even feel\nlike a buffet to me everything is kind\nof served on individual dishes so I feel\nlike I'm just going and getting\ndifferent Entre I'm switching things up\nand starting with dessert this time cuz\nI'm an adult everything here looks so\ngood I don't know what to get but check\nout this ice cream machine they got what\nwhat is your favorite dessert out of\neverything the vanilla mango can I get a\nscoop of that sure you can thank you\nyou're welcome thank you appreciate it I\nloaded up on a few other sweet treats\nthen I saw that they also have a custom\ns'mores station my man was lighting up\nthese s'mores with a blowtorch I had to\nget one thank you appreciate it now I\nrealize all of this dessert might make\nmy tummy hurt before I get to all of the\nreal food but it just looks so good I\ngot a cookies and cream cake the\nfanciest s'more I've ever seen in my\nlife and this mango ice cream I'm trying\nthis cookies and cream cake first here\nwe go I'm\npumped oh dude now this is what a fancy\nBuffet is all about next up we have the\nfanciest sore on planet Earth this was\nhand torched with Nutella on top I\nalready had a feeling this was going to\nbe good\nbut y'all I don't know if I need to get\nanything else at this Buffet I could eat\na hundred of these I feel like I've died\nand gone a food to heaven and this this\nis just dessert last but not least fresh\nmango ice cream with a tiny\nspoon oh dude that hits the spot it's\nlight and creamy honestly this was a\ngood move to eat right after the two\nchocolate\ndesserts all right so far we are off to\na very good start this Buffet is\nexceeding all of my expectations and the\ncrazy thing is this isn't even the most\nexpensive Buffet I'm going to in this\nvideo the one after this is more\nexpensive and even fancier I am not sure\nhow this Buffet can be topped but before\nI worry about all of that I think it's\ntime for some real food there are so\nmany options what's the most expensive\nlike food I can get here be y'all I'm\nnot sure if I heard him right but I have\nnever seen any Buffet serve wagu beef in\ncase you didn't know top quality wagu\nbeef sells for upwards of $200 a pound\nso this Buffet might be worth it after\nall thank you I also got some sausage\nfrom the meat station shrimp shumai a\nlittle salmon poke Bowl fresh pineapple\nand some\npotatoes so the real food has been\nacquired this smells amazing I'm going\nto be honest though the lighting does\nnot do the food justice but I promise it\nlooks better in person I'm going to try\nthe wagu first since it's supposedly the\nmost expensive thing you can get here so\nright off the bat I could tell something\nwas very wrong with the wagu when I\nstruggled to cut it Bona\nPetit Not only was it hard to\ncut it was also very difficult to\nchew this wagu trash it's lowkey super\nchewy and does not melt in your mouth\nthe way wag you should what is going on\nhere if the other food items are as\nmediocre as The Wack you I'm going to be\nvery disappointed okay let's try let's\nlet's try the other stuff thankfully\neverything else on my plate was a\nmillion times better this salmon poke\nBowl fantastic so I just got up for a\nsecond plate of food and I just came\nacross this huge line for something I\ndon't know what it is but it is looking\nlike the most popular food option here\nit's literally the only spot with a line\nlet's go see what it is I got in line\nand learned that this Buffet also has an\nOnDemand crepe station all of the Crepes\nlook so good I am overwhelmed again I\ndon't know what to get hi uh yes please\num what's your favorite one the banana\nthe banana okay I'll get that one day\nthank you appreciate it it so originally\nthe plan was to get more real people\nfood but after getting the grapes I\ndecided to load up on more desserts\nthey're so good I'm normally not even a\nsweets person but look at this this is\nbeautiful also another fun little fact I\ndon't actually like bananas but since\nthe crepe lady said the Banana Foster\nwas her favorite I panicked so hopefully\nI like this one we're taking a big boy\nbite oh my God this is fire the creest\nso light and even though there's so much\nstuff on top it's not too sweet which is\nperfect for me although the most\nexpensive item here was pretty whack the\nmost popular item on the other hand very\ntasty so I got to say I am very\nimpressed with this Buffet it smoked the\nbashio buffet by like a million per. but\nunfortunately I am going to have to tap\nout I'm getting full and I have another\nbuffet that I'm going to be eating at in\na few hours now there's just one more\nquestion left to answer I think my\nreactions made it pretty obvious but yes\nthis Buffet is worth it I'm definitely\ncoming back the next time I'm in Vegas I\nknow I said I didn't want to gamble but\nI was in such a great mood after finally\neating at a good Buffet I decided to\nstop at an electronic roulette game I'm\nputting $70 on red since that's how much\nmy Buffet meal cost and if I win that\nmeans the win buffet was\n[Music]\nfree let's go y'all that right there is\nhow you get a free meal oh my God it\nlooks like somebody's luck is finally\nstarting to\nchange it's dinner time yall behind me\nis Caesar's Palace this hotel is home to\nsome of the most popular restaurants in\nall of Vegas Gordon Ramsay's Hell's\nKitchen noou and most importantly the\nmost famous and expensive buffet in\nVegas the banol buffet let's head\n[Music]\ninside all right y'all so I just found\nthe buffet and I am ready to eat before\nI could check in I had to prepay for the\nmeal at a kiosk the total came out to be\n$19.11 making it the most expensive meal\nI'm having so far then because of how\npopular this Buffet is even though I had\na reservation I had to wait another 30\nminutes before I was finally taken to my\ntable all right y'all so I just got\nseated and first thing I want to point\nout this Buffet feels way different from\nthe wind Buffet the wind buffet was more\nlike fun and fancy this Buffet feels\nlike rich people fancy not only is the\nbanol buffet the most expensive buffet\nin Vegas it's also the largest one with\nover 250 food options it's open 7 days a\nweek and serves over 4,000 guests daily\nbut there is one issue I am very\noverwhelmed right now I was not aware\nthat I would only have a 90-minute time\nlimit in this Buffet do you have 90\nminutes if you want to get yourself\nstarted and then come back and get the\ndrinks from yourself but it's fine let's\ngo check out the buffet stations this\nplace is so big I just hope I get\nthrough all of it and have enough time\nto eat at the same time of course we got\nto see food station Chinese station\nKorean station Japanese station the\nMexican food station vegetarian stuff\nfancy people shaku Pizza the meats and\nfinally the most magical of all the\ndesert island there's probably a few\nstations that I completely left out by\naccident my bad all of this food looks\namazing so let's go get a plate since\nthis Buffet has so many options I was\nvery curious to see what their most\nexpensive item would be what's the most\nexpensive thing you can get like in the\nbuffet the crab legs well thank you well\nit's time for some king crab legs I made\nmy way over to the seafood station and\nyou could already tell that these crab\nlegs were expensive it's literally one\nof the only spots where someone's\nserving you food and I also grabbed this\nscallop dip honestly everything looks\nreally good but I am a little skeptical\nbecause so far out of all of the\nexpensive buffets I've been to the most\nexpensive items have been pretty garbage\nfor the most part I'm hoping that this\nBuffet changes things up a little bit\nespecially after the long wait even\nthough I had a reservation let's just\nlet's get cracking into these crab legs\nI don't know please Don't Judge Me by\nthe way I don't know how to use these\ncrab cracker things get the meat right\nout of the crab leg dip it in some\nbutter I'm not sure if the bar is just\nset really low because of the other\nbuffets but these are pretty fire also\nquick fun fact about this scallop dish\nthe guy at the seafood station whispered\nto me that this dish might actually be\nthe real most expensive item here you go\nto the store you find this one for 45 so\nthat's the\nexpensive all right thank you let's see\nhow it tastes I'm hoping it's good I'm\nnot sure whether these scallops really\nare the most expensive thing at this\nBuffet but I am positive these are\nphenomenal I think out of all of the\nbuffets I've been to for this vid these\nscallops are the best thing I've had so\nfar this is off to a really good start\nbut I had a little accident while trying\nto finish everything on my plate I just\nspilled all the butter oh my God I'm so\ndumb little greasy my table is now and\njust like that y'all plate number one\ndevoured it's time for plate number two\nsince the first round was all Seafood\nthis time I loaded up on the\nmeats I got a pork Taco wood grilled\nlamb T-Bone prime rib and a Chinese\nbarbecue pork rib y'all this smells so\ngood I want to be a good YouTuber and\nlike eat all of this slowly so that I\ncan describe it all to y'all but I'm\ngoing be honest I just want to eat I'll\nstill rate everything though first up\nthese Chinese barbecue ribs solid four\nout of five stars tacos were okay the\npork was really good but the tortilla\nkind of stale this lamb however was\ninteresting little hard to cut but\nflavor-wise very yummy oh they make some\nmean lamb here this is good all that's\nleft on my plate is the prime rib which\ncoincidentally is also the most popular\nitem at this Buffet I'm just praying\nit's better than the one from the\nBellagio oh just like melts in your\nmouth this is a good prime rib\nM but unfortunately according to the\nrules I believe I only have like 30\nminutes left at this Buffet I think I\nhave time for maybe one more plate of\nfood and\ndessert y'all this might be the dumbest\nthing to get here but why are they\nglizzies don't mind if I do I'm\ndefinitely not making my money back on\nthat one no it fell as for the rest of\nmy plate I wanted to grab something from\nevery other station just so I could try\neverything this Buffet has to offer but\nbam plate number three this time we got\na little Tuna poke Bowl Chinese pork bun\nsome pork lyia and this Gizzy let's give\nthis a sh\nokay I should not have gotten this this\nis pretty garbage Gizzy aside everything\nelse was surprisingly very tasty look at\nmy face I'm currently a very happy boy\nall right y'all so I've pretty much\ngotten something from every single\nstation but there is still one station\nthat I have not eaten from yet it's time\nfor dessert so far I'm very impressed\nwith the food from this Buffet but the\ndessert at the wind was my favorite part\nof that entire Buffet so I'm curious how\nthe desserts here will compare now just\nlike the wind there were so many\ndelicious options to choose from so I\njust started grabbing\neverything it's beautiful everything\nhere gorgeous I feel like I've said this\nbefore but I'm normally not a desserts\nguy but there's just something about the\nSweet Treats in Vegas this Cookie\nMonster cupcake delicious it turned my\ntongue blue this mini creme brulee just\nlook at my face I don't even know what\nthis is It's like a Vietnamese coffee\ncustard thing crazy I even got a\ncinnamon roll so I'm at that point where\nI am so full that it's kind of starting\nto hurt all I have left is this cute\nlittle ice cream cone\nthing it's it's not actually ice cream I\ndon't know what it\n[Music]\nis not\nbad all right y'all it's a little dark\nbut my time at the banol buffet is\nofficially over I enjoyed this place way\nmore than I expected and honestly I\nthink between this and the buffet at\nwind both of those places have changed\nmy opinion on buffets so without further\nAdo was the banol Buffet worth it if you\nhave the money I'd spend it\nhere speaking of money there's one more\nthing left for me to do I just bet $109\non black time for a free\n[Music]\nmeal y all don't gamble the casino\nalways wins so which buffet was your\nfavorite if you liked this video YouTube\nthinks you'll like this other one so go\ncheck it out bye\n[Music]\n",

        "Dylan, just a heads up to you and anyone else that wants to experience the buffets in Vegas, dinner is actually served at 3pm and on. Crab legs are available at all buffets during the weekends starting on Friday to Sunday (dinners only). Note to all, typically the dinner buffet cost (regardless of location) increases by nearly 100% when compared to both breakfast and/or lunch prices. The trick to save a tremendous amount of money is to set your reservation between 2pm to 2:30pm. If you get there prior to 3pm, you'll hit the \"better\" food items at lunch prices.",
        "Cheap buffets, especially here in vegas, use powdered eggs.  Also never go to a breakfast buffet, do brunch. If you can, take a local or get the casinos players card, you get discounts for locals at some places, and usually with the players card.  And NEVER go to anything less than 4 stars in Vegas.  The Wynn has the best buffet, always go on the weekend if you can get a spot. Also, FYI most strip buffets get their desserts from the same company, they're rarely made in house. 😊",

        "My family and I used to go to the Bacchanal Buffet every summer when we went to Vegas!! Unfortunately we stopped cuz of Covid lockdowns and bc they became super expensive. $100 is what we paid for for 4-5 people in my family and it was our highlight of the summer since we’re not rich. Sad to see it’s now $100 for one person and a time limit. Plus all the food and look is the same :(",
        "The only things you can find at Circus Circus are sadness and disappointment.",
        "The reason the wagyu was not what you were expecting is because wagyu is a term for four specific Japanese cattle breeds that vary immensity and don't even have to be raised in Japan. That along with the different marbling grades, the piece you ate was no better than normal beef you'd pick up at your local store.\n\nWhat you really want to be eating when thinking about Japanese wagyu is beef that has a specific location as the name: Kobe, Matsusaka, Omi ect along with it being a high marbling grade A4/A5.\n\nI hope that clears up some of the problems with \"wagyu\" beef that is heavily marketed and misleading to the general public.",
