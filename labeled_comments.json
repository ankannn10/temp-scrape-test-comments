Listening to the fact that school children are being taught about sexuality and some have undergone gender change surgery is absolutely disgusting 🤢 and disturbing to me. If that were to happen here in RSA, the teacher and or doctor will be lynched in public. No mentally sane nation would even let something like this become a mainstream talking point of politics. \n\nAbout the India issue, Nijjar was already wanted by interpol themselves with 2 red notices out for him also khalistanis are largely responsible for the rise of drug and gang violence in Canada. India warned the Canadian government about this 2 years ago yet the Trudeau government did nothing. The Khalistanis have been confirmed by both the Brazilian and Indian governments to have an involvement in the South American drug cartels. \n\nSo hypothetically if India did kill Nijjar, shouldn't Canadians be thankful to India as they've done more to combat crime in Canada than the actual Canadian government?.\n\nAs far as I see it, Trudeau is picking a fight with India to garner khalistanis vote bank and to distract from other problems like high house prices, food inflation and rising crime and violence in Canada also the accusations of China interfering in Canadian elections is yet to be resolved.",
