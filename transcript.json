    "transcript": "we can't even have a quiet fall Saturday\nevening here in Canada without Justin\nTrudeau ruining something and to add\nmore salt to the wound specifically\nwe're talking about India relations with\nCanada and how Justin Trudeau has just\nblown that up so much so that all of\nindiaan news is bashing Canada but\nspecifically Justin Trudeau yet again to\nthe point where even CTV you're going to\nsee later on in the video is like oh boy\nthis is not good between the can Canada\nand India relations so we're going to be\ntalking about the India stuff in the\nsecond half of the video the first half\nI want to reserve for this one-on-one\nsitdown between the premier of Alberta\nDanielle Smith who sits down with vashy\nto talk about how she's protecting kids\nrights specifically in Alberta which is\na major major win for I miners in\nAlberta but hopefully this is going to\nset the precedent for other provinces to\ndo the same thing across Canada to the\npoint where maybe we might even see some\nferal legislation being pushed forward\nto protect kids' rights welcome back to\nthe channel welcome back to another\nvideo everybody before we get into it I\ndo want to encourage you guys smash like\nbutton and subscribe if you haven't yet\nalready does really help G the channel\nand we have to talk quickly about\nprotecting ourselves specifically\nprotecting ourselves online which is a\ngreat segue for today's sponsor I'd like\nto thank today's sponsor private\ninternet access we've teamed up together\nand we're offering my audience 83% off\nfor using Code Sunshine which can be\nfound linked down Below in the\ndescription or the pinned comment below\nit's no surprise that we're living in a\ntime of censorship and Canada is\nunfortunately leading that race because\nof Justin Trudeau now Justin Trudeau\nwants to make sure that you can't see\nthe news he wants to make sure that you\ncan't see certain content on streaming\nplatforms like Netflix Hulu crave and\nyou shouldn't have Disney plus because\nof course our finance minister said if\nyou can't afford things you should\ncancel Disney plus so the way around\nthis is through a VPN such as

like your\npersonal information is at risk or the\ngovernment getting and selling your\npersonal information and the best way\nthat I like to go about this best cloak\nthat I like to put over myself is\nprivate internet access which again can\nbe found linked Down Below in the\ndescription or the pin comment below for\n83% off thank you private internet\naccess for sponsor ing this video\nwithout further Ado let's get into this\none-on-one interview here we go I wanted\nto start off on the timing of this and\nand more bluntly why this is a priority\nfor you right now albertans for example\nare still waiting on the tax break that\nyou promised in the election if lower\noil prices hold your Surplus will\nevaporate into a deficit more than half\na million albertans don't have a family\ndoctor the number of people in Edmonton\nexperiencing homelessness we just found\nout yesterday has jumped by 2,000 in the\nlast year to sit at 5,000 are you doing\nthis now to bolster your support uh in\nyour party's leadership review this\nweekend well look we are focused on all\nof those issues we've got a budget that\nwill be coming through in February where\nwe hope we'll be able to accelerate the\ntax cut we've been uh refocusing the\nHealth Care system so that one of our\npriorities could be met that every\nperson has a family doctor or a nurse\npractitioner and we've set up navigation\ncenters in both Calgary and Edmonton to\nbegin getting services to those who are\nwho are on the streets so we can we can\ndo a lot of things all at once we're a\nvery active government and this is a\npriority that has been identified by\nparents we've identified problems as\nwell um internationally with new\nevidence coming forward like the cast\nreport in the UK and we felt that that\nit was time to put some guidelines\naround these\nissues again though I I'm unclear as to\nwhy the need for it uh I take your point\non other reports in other places that\nthat have been conducted but I think\nthat vash's digging a little too much\ninto this and trying to tie in the uh\nleadership review which is happening\nagain as previously stated this weekend\nin terms of Danielle Smith and just her\ncompetence if she's still fit to be um\npremier of Alberta it's happening\ninternally but this is something that\nDanielle Smith has said you know like\nalmost as far back as a year ago and\nthen Pier pev came out afterwards saying\nthis should absolutely be done and he\nstands with you know parents's right to\nprotect their kids so the fact that\nshe's trying to tie it between just the\nleadership review and um it's a bit of a\nfar stretch but there's only I think the\npopulation in Alberta from what I read\nin the last stats can of trans people\nwas just 37% of the population the\ngovernment only can can only have so\nmany priorities can only generate so\nmany outcomes why again would you choose\nthis how are albertans to assume\nanything other than you would like to\nCurry favor with certain aspects of your\nbase well I think families and parents\nwant to know what's going on with their\nkids that's kind of where it began we\nhave a lot of parents who got in touch\nwith us concerned about what was being\ntaught in schools and so one of the\naspects that we're we're doing is making\nsure that parents have an opin on sexual\norientation sexuality and gender\nideology classes so that they can either\nopt their kids into it or at least be\nable to have a conversation with them\nwhen they come home we also know that\nthe beginning of transition happens with\nthe social transition and we think it's\nimportant that if there's a formal name\nchange or formal pronoun change that\nparents aren't the last to know parents\nalso need to be included in that\ndecision so that they can help and\nsupport their child every step of the\nway yeah in addition we we know that\nthese are really complex issues with\nkids we want to make sure that they've\ngot appropriate mental health support\ncounseling support so that they don't\nmake a decision prematurely that might\nimpact their fertility or impact uh\ntheir their their uh their personal\nhealth for the rest of their lives so we\nyeah I mean it's gotten so bad that my\nwife and I have we're like 90% of the\nway decided that we're going to be\nhomeschooling specifically because of\nthis corrupt wild radical SOI program\nthat's in the school curriculum here in\nBritish Columbia and had John rustad won\num the the premier race and be the new\npremier of British Columbia and had we\nhad um should should have we had a\nconservative majority my wife and I\nwould have maybe leaned a little bit\nmore in favor of not necessarily\nhomeschooling but putting them in the\nschool system but still kind of 50/50\nsplit but like I said we're about 90% of\nthe way that there's still a couple\nyears to to decide on what exactly we're\ngoing to do but I know a lot of people\nare definitely big advocates for\nhomeschooling these days because of just\nhow crazy the school curriculum is here\nin Canada we want to make sure that kids\nare making these decisions when they're\nmature enough to be able to make\nthem you said at the beginning that\nyou're basing it on what a lot of\nparents have told you H how many parents\noh I don't know hundreds thousands we we\nhear about it all the time there's a\ndifference\nI I fair enough I mean there's enough\nconcern out there that we have heard\nabout it in town halls we hear about it\nin letters to that come into our offices\nwe hear about it in the meetings that we\nhave and so this is the reason why we\nknew that we need to tact on it when\nwhen you have decisions that are being\nmade that could affect a a child's\nhealth we believe that they need to make\nthose as adults and that's part of the\nthe reason for why we're moving ahead on\nthis I do want to give props to vashy um\nyou know she she's definitely got that\nRBF going but it's not only towards the\nconservatives it's towards both sides\nshe has been super I'm going to quote on\nliit say hypercritical of liberal\nministers and just everyone that is\nrunning government right now at the\nfederal level and now we're finding out\neven towards uh the provincial level\nwith the premier so she's been pretty\nfair across the board um and and kudos\nto her the scope of them according to\ninformation from your own government\nthere were only eight gender affirming\ntop surgeries for youth in Alberta\nbetween January 22 and February 2023\nthere were nearly 2700 total claims for\nnon-surgical interventions over the same\nperiod but your government could not\nclarify exactly how many of those\ntreatments were for things other than\ngender dysphoria and actually the only\nthing you could clarify your government\ncould clarify was that the majority of\nthem were were did represented stuff\nthat was not gender disphoria so so what\nagain I'll I'll put to you like what is\nthe need that you are actually\naddressing here if the people that you\nare protecting are so few in number well\nI can tell you Kelly was one of the\nindividuals who came to us today and she\nspoke with us and she's an individual\nwho transitioned to male as an adult\nrealized that it was not the right\ndecision for her and transition back and\nshe's now created a detransitioning\norganization to help others do so and\nshe said you know if I was unclear and\nuncertain at age 37 how's a 10-year-old\nsupposed to know this kids need to be\nable to get the mental health support\nand also the the appropriate medical\nsupport Family Support before they make\nsome of these incredibly life-altering\ndecisions I mean our main purpose is to\nmake sure that kids aren't making\ndecisions that will prematurely prevent\nthem from being able to have kids of\ntheir own one day there are certain\ndecisions that you make as an adult we\nwe put all kinds of restrictions on\nchildren until they their brain has\ndeveloped to a point where they\nunderstand the consequences of their\ndecisions and these are adult decisions\nand so we're going to make sure that\nkids have the opportunity to make them\nwhen they're older\nand that should be the end of the\ndiscussion right there there should not\nbe any more discussion around this it\nshould just be boom that's it no more\nthere's no if ands or buts that was\nperfectly well said uh Premier Danielle\nSmith and and do you have evidence that\nbeyond that one example you've provided\nany of those eight surgeries for example\nthat took place in the last year did not\ninclude any kind of guidance or\ncounseling or mental health help or that\ntheir parents were against it again a\nquestion of what evidence you're basing\nthese decisions on well if you look at\nthe C report uh she went through and\ngave Dr Hillary Cass and gave the most\ncomprehensive fouryear study of all of\nthe evidence that's out there and quite\nfrankly where the evidence is lacking is\non the long-term consequences of puberty\nblockers and cross seex hormones and\nwhat happens with kids when they\ntransition how many of them remain happy\nwith that decision well into adulthood\nhow many of them detransition these are\nall things that we need to know we\nshouldn't be experimenting on children\nand so we want to make sure that we have\ngood counseling with appropriate doctor\nsupport appropriate parental support and\nthat kids are old enough and mature\nenough to be able to make and understand\nthe decisions that they're making so we\nwe're putting some guidelines around it\nwe think we found the right balance\nthere you go and that's that's\nphenomenal I think more people than ever\nare going to be jumping on board with um\nwith that decision Premier Smith good\njob on protecting Alberta and now we're\ngoing to shift things into to India\nbecause why not we just can't have a\nnormal just a normal weekend here in\nCanada India a cyber um adversary says\nTrudeau government New Delhi shreds\nclaim the ministry of uh external\nAffairs said that under Justin Trudeau's\nAdministration senior Canadian officials\nhave openly confessed that Canada is\nseeking to manipulate Global opinions\nagainst India New Delhi the true doled\nCanadian government's latest actions\nsuggest it has started treating India as\nan enemy country India has been added to\na list of enemy nations in terms of\ncyber security and has been labeled a\ncyber adversary New Delhi today called\nit another Canadian strategy to attack\nand malign India\ninternationally that is craziness oh my\ngoodness in a press conference to today\nthe ministry of external Affairs also\nsaid that under the Trudeau's\nAdministration senior Canadian officials\nhas openly confessed that Canada is\nseeking to manipulate Global opinions\nagainst India the foreign Ministry also\nsaid that like other instances the these\nallegations and cyber security reports\nare made without a shred of evidence we\nsee this as another Canadian strategy to\nattack India their senior officials have\nopenly confessed that Canada is seeking\nto manipulate GL Global opinions against\nIndia oh my goodness that is horrible\nand then CTV is also reporting India um\ntrashes Canada for linking home minister\nto seek activist\nplot diplomatic row led to the expulsion\nof each uh other's tops top diplomats\nlast month even though it was proven\nthat India recalled their diplomats\nbefore Canada was able to publicly say\nthat they are being expelled so it's\njust a matter of timing but very weird\nsemantics on on Canada's part the\ngovernment of India's uh protest in the\nstrongest\nterms uh to the Absurd and baseless\nreferences made to the Union home\nminister of\nIndia wow Canada's Deputy foreign\naffairs minister David Morrison told\nParliament members of the National\nSecurity committee on Tuesday that he\nhad confirmed uh Shams name to the\nWashington Post which first reported the\nallegations Morrison did not explain how\nCanada knew of Shams alleged involvement\nso you have Canadians and I've I've made\nvideos about this recently you have\nCanadians that are literally leaking\ninformation to American journalists like\nthis is this is just so deepr rooted\nit's not a good look for Canada let's\ntake a look at Global news's video here\nIndia is slamming Canada for linking its\nhome minister to alleged plots against\nsix separatists foreign Ministry\nspokesperson rander jaswell announced\nSaturday that India has lodged protest\nwith Canada The Washington Post reported\nlast month that Canadian officials\nalleged Amit Shaw was behind violence\nand intimidation of six separatists in\nCanada Canadian Deputy foreign affairs\nminister David Morrison told a\nparliamentary panel on Tuesday that he\nhad provided that information to the\nnewspaper India has previously denied\nany role in the alleged targeting of\nsick dissidents the dispute has led to\nexpulsions of diplomats in both\ncountries some of our Consular\nofficials have\nrecently were recently informed by the\nCanadian government that they have been\nand continued to be under audio and\nvideo\nsurveillence their Communications have\nalso been\nintercepted we have formerly protested\nto the Canadian\ngovernment as we deem these actions to\nbe a flagrant violation of relevant\ndiplomatic and Consular\nconventions by citing\ntechnicalities the Canadian government\ncannot justify the fact that it is\nindulging in harassment and\nintimidation our diplomatic and Consular\nPersonnel are already functioning in an\nenvironment of extremism and violence\nthis action of the Canadian government\naggravates the situation and is\nincompatible with established diplomatic\nnorms and practices government of India\nprotests in the strongest terms to the\nAbsurd and baseless references made to\nthe Union home minister of India before\nthe committee by Deputy Minister David\nMorrison in fact the Revelation that\nhigh Canadian officials deliberately\nleak unfounded ins\nsituations to the international media as\npart of a conscious strategy to\ndiscredit\nIndia and influence other nations only\nconfirms The View government of India\nhas long held about current Canadian\ngovernment's political\nagenda and behavioral pattern such\nirresponsible actions will have serious\nconsequences for Bal TI oh my goodness\nman we can't just have a normal freaking\nweek here in Canada and then to add the\nicing on top of the cake here's India\nnews just going all in on Justin true\nnow welcome back thank you for staying\nwith CNN news 18 now let's talk about\nthe international front now amid India\nCanada tension Natalie drin the NSA to\nthe Prime Minister trudo has in fact\nmade a shocking claim now Natalie has\nclaimed that it was a strategic decision\nto leak information to the Washington\nPost and she along with the deputy\nforeign minister David Morrison leaked\nthe information let's listen into what\nexactly natal had to say\nDeputy Minister Morrison and I spoke to\nthe Washington Post on background late\nSunday afternoon October\n13 we provided non-classified\ninformation on the action we had taken\nto cooperate with India and explain how\nthe evidence showed links to the\ngovernment of India conducting illegal\nactivities against Canadians including\nthreats to their lives the government of\nIndia has from the beginning accused\nCanada of engaging in a politically\nmotivated investigation and using the\nCanadian media to further\nthis this is clearly not the case\nhowever we were prepared for this\naccusation to\nresurface therefore we made a strategic\ndecision to engage a respected\ninternational news outlet that had\nalready published on the subject to\nensure the record ORD was straight and\nthat our side of the story would be\nwidely\nheard let me now go across to my\ncolleague sidhant Mishra sidhant a very\nshocking claim that is in fact coming in\nin fact a confession that is coming in\nuh from Natalie in fact she went on to\nsay that it was a leak from their own\nside it was a strategy from their own\nside what was the message that they were\ntrying to send out by leaking it to a US\npublication in in order you know\nirrespective of actually directly\nengaging with India they went ahead and\nleaked it to a US\npublication look U you know that's what\nthey are saying that it's a strategic U\num decision to leak a certain piece of\ninformation to the to the leading\npublication in the United States in fact\nthey were questioned also by by the\ncommittee that uh that why uh this was\nnot done to the Canadian newspapers\nCanadians should know first about uh\nabout anything regarding this case as\nCanadian citizen has died perhaps that\nwas an argument which committee gave to\nthem but they said that it has been done\nstrategically it's a strategic decision\nbut the fact is Sharon that U it\ninvolves the reputation of one country\nand it also involves the reputation of\nthe home minister of one country without\nany proof the NSA and the deputy foreign\nminister rank officials are leaking\ninformation to the Foreign Press perhaps\nimplicating the involvement of the\nsitting home minister of the world's\nlargest Dem democracy and that is\nwithout any proof perhaps shows that how\ndesperate the tudo administration is\nwhen it comes to blaming bashing and\nimplicating uh India Point number one uh\nPoint number two is that uh that you\nknow it has been more than one year not\na single shed of evidence has been\nshared with India all what the Trudeau\ngovernment want to do is Media trial and\nleaking information to Media sensitive\nclassified information to Media so that\nthey can U make their Cas stronger in\nthe in the media and media narrative uh\ngoes against uh India that is perhaps\nwhat they are looking at uh right now\nand the third is that if it had been any\nother country sharing there would have\nbeen an action on the senior officials\nwhoever had leaked uh such kind of\nsensitive information which involves uh\nthe home minister or a senior officer of\nany other country you know name of any\nother country because it has it is it is\ndirectly you know maligning the\nreputation image of somebody without any\nproof without any evidence uh so you\nknow that this is not the first time\nJustin Trudeau has done this right he's\ndone he's he's leaked information or\ninsiders within the Canadian government\nhave leaked information on multiple\noccasions involving India and then also\nthe baseless claims like I'm not here to\ndefend India by any means but they are\nthe largest democracy and I don't see\nJustin Trudeau's angle for trying to\nattack India the way he has been going\nat it for the past year since the uh the\nkilling of the the SE separatist labeled\nas a terrorist in India njar Singh that\nhappened here in in Siri BC like this is\njust Insanity all around no matter how\nyou look at it the way Justin Trudeau is\nhanding the diplomatic relations between\nCanada and India is so po that Canada is\nnot going to have a good relationship\nwith India for a very very long time\nthat shows that how desperate the\nTrudeau Administration is to do media\ntrial against India to malign the\nreputation of the Indian politician to\nimplicate India in this case and and and\nyou know and they are ready to go to any\nextent they're ready even to leak the\nclassified information Sharon leaking\nclassified information is not allowed in\nany country not even in Canada also so\nthey may be saying that the information\nwasn't classified uh and and you know it\nwas it was a strategic decision but the\nfact is that it falls under the\nclassified category because it till now\nthe Canada doesn't have any proof of him\nbeing directly involved and the fourth\nand important one is that NSA has said\nthat she has not leaked the information\nof home minister regarding the home\nminister or she has not given name of\nthe home minister but the foreign\nminister David Morrison is saying that\nyes I did confirm fromit to the\njournalist so there again there is a\ncontradiction between what NSA is saying\nand what foreign minister is saying so\nit's complete looks like it's a b up um\nyou know episode which was started by\nJustin tudo and since nothing is being\nachieved so you know they are\ndesperately you know using all sorts of\ntactics by leaking things to Media by\ndoing media trial by fronting RCM etc\netc so that you know the pressure is can\nbe built on India and in and and you\nknow and and you there's a there's a\nthere's a narrative which could be\ncreated so that it helps Mr trudo\npolitically okay thank you thank you San\nfor getting us all those details and\nwith that we'll slip into a short break\nmore news and updates yeah I mean it's\nnot looking good for Justin Trudeau he's\nyou know ruining relationships and when\nit comes time inevitably for pier PV to\ninherit um you know that job as prime\nminister of Canada he's going to have a\nlot of um of you know put a lot of\nGreece into reuniting these\nrelationships like India is the largest\ndemocracy in the world I'm personally\nnot interested in our diplomatic\nrelations going to Absolute crap I don't\nthink anybody really is at the same time\nCanada still has to protect you know our\nsovereignty and make sure that we're not\nbeing penetrated or infiltrated by\nForeign governments but at the same time\nthere's a way to handle certain\nsituations diplomatically like you know\nthe fact that Canada was harboring a\nlike somebody who was literally labeled\nas a terrorist in India for a lot of\ntime and you know India was trying to\nfigure something out in Canada Justin\nChau the liberal government was just not\nhaving anything to do with it I I think\nthis is you know it's a disgrace um I\ndon't think this is a good look and I\nthink a lot of Canadians wish that um\nthis was not happening so on behalf of\nCanada I think we're sorry I don't think\nthis is a good look all around but\nnonetheless that's my personal opinion\nand I would absolutely love to know\nyours This Is the End video Everybody\nI'd like to thank you for watching this\nfar and if you did enjoy it I'd like to\nencourage you guys to smash like button\nand subscribe if you haven't yet already\ndoes really help grow the channel just\nremember that supporting the sponsors of\nthis channel does um support this\nchannel thanks so much and I'll see you\nguys in the next one bye for now\n"
