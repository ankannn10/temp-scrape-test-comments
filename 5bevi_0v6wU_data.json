    "transcript": "Nick: Robots are becoming more and more like humans.\nThey can build cars, clean your house, and even do parkour.\nBut in this video, I'm cooking against three levels of robots to find out who's the better\nchef. Robots or humans.\nFor level one, Mark Rober will be the judge.\nMark: We're gonna see if Nick can beat some of the most basic kitchen robots that money can buy.\nAnd level one will have five speed rounds chopping, stirring, toasting, pizza making\nand cleaning. And to win, it's a classic best three out of five.\nNick: Are you Team Robot or Team Nick?\nMark: I mean.\nOf course I am Team Robot.\nFor this first mini round, we'll be testing chopping skills.\nAnd in the robot corner, we've got the robot coup.\nIt's basically an extremely powerful food processor with a couple of googly eyes to\nboot. I like putting googly eyes on my robots.\nAre you ready, Nick? Nick: Let's do.\nThis.\nMark: Start! Nick: Now?\nMark: Let's start. Yeah, I'm taking my time.\nI'm not worried. Oh. How many do you want me to put in, Nick?\nNick: I mean, your team robot.\nMark: That's true. That feels like a good start.\nOh, no. Oh, that's so fast.\nOh, my God, I didn't even have the time to put it under.\nNick: This seems so unfair.\nMark: Look at that. They're like perfect cubes.\nNick: Before you actually judge, let's look at our cuts.\nMark: Yours aren't even real cubes.\nThose are like rectangular prisms.\nI mean, this is like laser precision.\nAs a chef, do you want smaller cubes like that or bigger?\nNick: I mean, it.\nTakes more skill to make smaller cubes.\nMark: I rule in favor of our robot overlords real quick.\nNick: Speaking of potatoes, my merch brand Happy Potato is 20% off just in time for the\nholidays. You can shop any time from November 9th to 14th on a first come, first\nserve basis, while supplies last and the discount is applied at checkout.\nYou must click the YouTube shopping buttons below to be eligible, and I added more\ndetails in the description below.\nMark: For Speed Round number two, we're going to be testing your stirring skills.\nYou will be facing off against an army of five stirring robots, once again with googly\neyes.\nNick: They are very cute. Mark:Thank you. Nick: Because stirring just one pan wouldn't be much of a\nchallenge. We each have five pans, but there's just one of me and there are five\nrobots. We're going to be stirring pine nuts, which are expensive and burn really\neasily.\nMark: So the first person to burn their nuts loses.\nThat doesn't sound great.\nNick: Okay, here we go.\nMark: Time to turn on the robot army.\nAnd as soon as I start smelling and especially seeing burnt pine nuts, somebody\nlosing this.\nNick: Seems a little unfair again. Mark: I don't know.\nSo we're getting good spinning.\nBut the problem is, is it's spinning in place and not going to every edge of the pan.\nAlso, I think like two googly eyes have dropped into the pan.\nThat feels like a definite points off situation.\nI have seen you spill a few nuts and I don't love that.\nNick.\nNick: Yeah, but your robots aren't even touching the nuts.\nI actually think I might win this challenge.\nI'm actually going to do something the robots can't do and switch my pans around to\nkind of keep things even as well.\nAnd the robots, they just don't have arms are the.\nMark: Robot feet are melting.\nHe's melting. Stoves off, stoves off.\nNick: What happened here?\nMark: Disaster.\nOn the robot front, it completely charred these pine nuts.\nAnd on top of that, the plastic feet melted in the pan.\nWow. This is a nice, even golden brown.\nLet me taste test.\nThat's good. I don't have the courage to try any of these plastics.\nNot necessarily my thing.\nThis one's an easy call, Nick.\nWinner of this round.\nWe're all tied up heading into speed.\nRound number three for round three, we'll be testing your ability to make toast.\nIt's very simple, but easy to screw up from personal experience.\nOn the robot side, we have this extremely high tech $500 toaster with a screen.\nSo where's your screen, Nick?\nNick: On the human side, I have a good old pen with some fire.\nMark: Is that how you actually make toast at home?\nNick: Yeah. Mark: You're so fancy.\nAt the end of this round, I will judge the winner based on looks and taste.\nNick: Here we go. Mark: Oh, wow.\nBread. English muffin.\nWaffle. Bagel.\nHey, do your thing.\nDon't look over here and start.\nOh, there it goes.\nSo the key.\nNick: To making a nice slice of toast, Mark, while your toaster just slowly takes its sweet time\nover there. I like to quickly hit both sides of the toast right away, and you have to be\nvery gentle. You don't want to press into the toast.\nMark: Wait, why?\nNick: Tweezers? I'm cooking against a $500 robot.\nIt's all about precision.\nMark: Okay. How are we doing here?\nOh. It's browning.\nOh, I feel like I smell and see smoke, though.\nOh, it's a countdown now.\nSeven. Six. Five.\nYeah. Where's your countdown?\nCome to papa.\nOh, wow.\nOkay, actually, that is pretty exact.\nNick: The key with toast is to make sure that the outside is nice and crispy, while the inside\nstays nice and light and fluffy.\nMark: This is a butter knife, right?\nNick: No. Oh, my gosh, look at that.\nMark: Oh, wow. That looks like grilled cheese.\nNick: I'm even gonna get the sides.\nWhy don't you do that toaster?\nMark: I'm nervous about this one.\nYou're putting a lot of chef's kiss in that so that I can be a very impartial judge.\nI'm gonna close my eyes, and it's just the one bite challenge.\nYou know the rules. Nick: Mark.\nI'm gonna shuffle them around. Okay, so, number one.\nMark: Can you do, like, an airplane sound?\nThat makes me want to cry.\nIt's so good. Can we just do one more bite at number one before we move on?\nNick: Sure. Mark: And with the airplane sounds.\nMhm. Mhm.\nI didn't know toast could taste so good.\nNick: Number two I'm not doing airplanes.\nMark: By comparison this is just like a wet sock.\nNumber one by a nautical mile.\nNick: Number one was me.\nMark: Wow. Okay, well, I finished eating this.\nThe score is now humans.\nTwo robots, one for speed round number four.\nWe're going to see who can make the best pizza man versus robot.\nAnd this is a doozy here.\nAll I have to do is load in the sauce.\nNow I just got to add in some cheese.\nPut my dough right there.\nNick: I haven't even started.\nMark: All right, here we go. It's scanning the pizza.\nLook at that laser scan.\nSauce goes on.\nNow, right here is where it's putting the pepperonis on.\nNick: It seems.\nSuper unfair.\nMark: Wow. Put that in the Louvre.\nI want to see how many pizzas I can make in the time it takes you to make one, Nick.\nNick: I'm still just rolling out my dough.\nMark: While I'm over here. Laser scanning pizzas.\nNot only are you taking forever, but you're also making a mess.\nLuckily, round five deals with cleaning up messes.\nDo you need any help?\nNick: Do you know how to make a pizza?\nMark: I do not.\nNick: At this point, I'm just trying to finish my pizza before Mark makes number four.\nYeah. Yeah.\nAll right.\nMark: Well, you have exactly 40s.\nNick: I can do 40s.\nLet's just do a little bit of olive oil.\nMark: Oh, never mind. It's done.\nIt was done.\nNick: I'm done. Two very, very different looking pizzas.\nMark: Very different looking.\nThat looks like it's about to go into an Easy-Bake oven.\nThese are masterpieces.\nLike put these in a brick oven.\nNick: Already, I feel like this is off to an unfair start, but it's not done yet.\nI think we should bake them.\nMark: We need to bake them.\nOkay. Time's up.\nAnd Nick's pizza looks interesting.\nNow, as for the robot, look at that.\nAesthetically, the robot definitely has it at this point, but let's see how they taste\nhuman first.\nThat's like a 4.8.\nNick: Now for the.\nRobots.\nMark: To be honest, the taste is pretty similar.\nThe robot has a way better ratio of like dough to cheese to pepperoni.\nIt's just a much more balanced bite.\nRobot takes it, and that means going into the fifth and final round.\nIt's robots. Two.\nNick. Two.\nWe are tied.\nAnd speaking of the final round, it's an absolute mess back here.\nThanks to Nick. Time for our cleanup challenge.\nAll right, this is it.\nFifth and final round.\nNick, you made quite a mess here.\nI'm adding a little extra.\nIt's you versus the Roomba cleaning robot.\nI'm going to divide this down the middle.\nYou have to clean that side.\nThe roombas got to clean this side.\nWhy did you.\nNick: Give me so much more to clean?\nMark: Now, remember.\nThis is winner takes all.\nWhoever wins this round wins all of level one.\nOkay? Come on, boy, do something.\nOh, wow. That's good.\nThat is way cleaner than I was expecting.\nNick: That's making me extremely nervous.\nMark: The problem.\nIs, he's going the wrong way.\nNick: Not to brag, but I'm doing pretty well over here.\nMark: Roomba, where are you going?\nYou hardly did any work.\nYou didn't earn a docking station.\nOh, here he comes. Let's go.\nNick: Round two, baby.\nOh, he's getting my side dirty again.\nYeah!\nMark: Sabotage! Robot, where are you going?\nNo, I think I'm ready for the final verdict.\nWell, given that we were tied heading into this round.\nNick, whoever won this clean up round wins all of level one.\nAnd after looking at the results, the winner for all of level one between robots and\nhumans is the humans.\nYes, Nick.\nNick: Congratulations. I am sorry, Mark, because I know you wanted robots to win.\nDeep down, I really did.\nMark: Robots don't let me down in level two.\nYou got this for level two.\nNick: I'll be cooking against Molly, the world's first fully robotic kitchen.\nI'm kind of scared. It took ten years of research to make this robot, and it can\nrecreate movements of a professional chef and has over 5000 recipes uploaded to its\nmemory. We're going head to head to see who can make a better pasta dish, and at the end,\na blind taste test will determine who wins this round.\nBefore we start cooking, I'm going to choose the recipe that Molly is going to make today.\nAnd since we're doing pasta, I'm going to go with a spaghetti puttanesca.\nI just found out that this is a kill switch, so if he starts beating me, I'm just gonna\nwhack it. It's time to find out if Molly's really worth that $100,000 price tag.\nAnd here he goes. First things first.\nIt looks like he's turning on the cooktop.\nOh, we're going for the olive oil.\nGood start. Moly.\nNow it's grabbing some olives, anchovies, some garlic, some capers.\nSometimes I feel like moly is just doing fancy movements to flex on all of us.\nWhat? Using a spatula.\nMoly. Scraping the bottom of the pan right now.\nMaking sure all those nice little flavorful bits aren't sitting there and burning.\nThe more I watch right now, the more nervous I'm getting about this competition.\nThinking about pressing the red button it just tapped and now is scraping off the extra\ningredients on the spatula.\nThis is unbelievable.\nAnd then we go with the tomato sauce and he's gonna mix it all up.\nHere comes the pasta. Oh, come on with the tap.\nThat just seems like you're rubbing it in.\nSome of that pasta is sitting above the water right now, so I'm wondering if moly is\ngoing to do anything to make sure that that goes under the water.\nOh, okay. At this point, you have to wonder if the robot just heard me say that.\nOr maybe it's just really that smart on its own.\nSo I'm guessing right now that moly has it down to an exact timing.\nAnd I'm thinking right now that this might be the most perfectly cooked pasta I have\never seen in my life. Oh, you missed a noodle, moly.\nLet me help you. It's very well cooked.\nThis here seems like the final step.\nJust throwing in these herbs.\nSo after one last wipe of the spatula, it looks like the dish is complete.\nThat was amazing. The only chance that I might have is if the judge picks up on that.\nSome of the pasta might be a little bit less cooked than the rest of the pasta.\nMolly didn't quite fully stir it all the way here, but I'm gonna help Molly plate it onto\na nice dish so the judge cannot tell which is the robots and which is mine.\nI'm going into this challenge a bit nervous, but for my dish, I'll be making an uni butter\npasta to begin, I'm starting out with this fresh sea urchin.\nSea urchin tastes almost like butter, so it's going to be perfect with our pasta.\nFirst, I'll add these to a small blender, making sure to use plenty.\nThen for a bit of acidity, I'll add just a touch of yuzu juice and for a bit of color,\njust a touch of saffron oil.\nNow, because we want to make an uni butter, I'll take a few nice knobs of butter and add\nthat to my uni. Once it reaches a nice smooth and creamy consistency, our uni butter\nis done. Now I'm actually going to cook my pasta a little bit earlier than Molly cooked\nhis. I'll start by tossing a generous amount of salt into my pasta water, and then in we\ngo with some fresh homemade pasta.\nYou hear that, robot?\nHomemade pasta.\nI'll go in with a bit of pasta water to a new pan, and then drop in a nice few\nspoonfuls of our fresh uni butter.\nWe'll mix this together so it forms a nice sauce.\nAnd then in goes our pasta.\nI know robots aren't supposed to be able to feel emotions, but I have a feeling Molly's\nscared right now. I'll add in my pasta.\nNice and tight in the center of my plate, then finish with a nice drizzle of herb oil.\nA few pieces of fresh sea urchin and just a few nice microgreens.\nTime to see who wins.\nAfter a bit of plating help, here's the robot spaghetti puttanesca.\nAnd here's my dish and uni butter pasta.\nThe way they're plated, the judge shouldn't be able to tell who made which dish.\nHarrison will be the judge for our blind taste test.\nHarrison: Oh, damn.\nI'm being honest right now.\nI have no clue which one's which.\nI'm gonna start with the uni bar pasta.\nI've never had uni, by the way, before, so this is like a first time for everything.\nThat is insane. Puttanesca.\nHere we go. This.\nThis is. This is good.\nI'm just trying to figure out how is a robot sliced olives, put capers over.\nBut then how have we got uni over here?\nI'm so sorry if I get this wrong.\nI think the robot made the uni pasta.\nI'm gonna say the puttanesca tastes better.\nNick: That's made by the robot.\nHarrison: No it's not.\nI'm so sorry.\nNick: I just lost to a robot fair and square.\nThat means we're tied 1 to 1, and it all comes down to round three.\nFor level three, our final challenge, I'll be cooking a steak against Neo Beta, an\nadvanced humanoid robot.\nWhat's up, Neo? Neo: How's it going?\nYeah, the way this will work is simple.\nIn front of us are three steaks.\nWe've got a porterhouse, a filet mignon and a ribeye.\nWe're each gonna cook one, and the audience will decide in the comments below who is the\ntrue champion.\nNeo: How about we do rock, paper, scissors to see who picks first?\nNick: I'm down for rock paper scissors.\nYou ready? Rock, paper, scissor.\nShoot.\nNeo: I beat you.\nNick: Fair is fair. You get to pick first.\nGo ahead.\nNeo: My dad likes the porterhouse the most.\nPersonally, I'm usually a ribeye guy.\nBut today I'm going to go with the filet.\nNick: You're going with the filet?\nNeo: Yeah, just a classic cut.\nGo for it.\nNick: It's all you. Oh, I'm probably gonna go with the ribeye.\nThe steaks have been chosen.\nBest of luck. Chef Neo.\nNeo: Let the best chef win. That's a weak handshake.\nNick: The first thing with a steak, of course, is salt and pepper.\nSo I'm going to go salt all over my beautiful ribeye.\nAnd I can see you're also starting with your salt.\nBy the way, how long have you been cooking?\nI'm curious. Neo: Three months.\nNick: You've only been cooking for three months?\nNeo: I'm only a year old. What do you expect?\nI read a little bit about cooking steaks on Wikipedia before this.\nNick, I don't know if you know or not, but when you season a steak, you're supposed to\nget all the different sides.\nNick: I don't know if you're.\nTrying to get my head or what you're doing, but it's not going to work.\nNeo: I'm ready to cook.\nNick: You know how to turn on the burner?\nNeo: Of course. I'm just gonna twist this knob real quick.\nAnd there it is.\nNick: Nice job.\nNeo: All right, I'm just gonna grab my poke.\nSorry about that. All right, that's all right.\nTake it up real quick.\nNick: Okay. That is impressive.\nDo you mind if I borrow that? Yeah.\nNeo: Let me just grab it for you real quick.\nNick: Thank you so much I appreciate it.\nOkay. Perfect. So our oil is in both of our pans.\nI think my oil is getting to that temp that I'm ready to put my stake in.\nWhat about.\nNeo: You? Me, too. Nick, would you mind handing me that spatula over there?\nNick: Yeah, absolutely. Not a problem at all.\nNeo: Just gonna pick it up nice and careful here.\nAnd just like that.\nNice and easy.\nNick: Are you ready for this sound? Yeah.\nNeo: Let's see it. Pretty good.\nWhen you stir, you just want to make sure it's fully flat to get the best sear possible\non the bottom of the steak.\nSo I'm just applying some light pressure with the spatula here.\nI'm going for the flip. Nick, check this out.\nAnd there it is.\nNick: Oh my gosh.\nNo way. You just did that.\nAll right, I'm gonna go for my flip now.\nMine doesn't look as good as yours.\nNeo: All right, Nick, I'm gonna go in for the butter.\nThree. Two. One.\nAnd. Oh!\nTouchdown!\nNick: You're actually butter basting now?\nYep. How do you even know what that is?\nNeo: I was watching a lot of Food Network last week.\nNick: Mine's actually done. I'm gonna go ahead and start resting it.\nNeo: I'm not allowed to use knives, so could you help me?\nI just need those potatoes behind me over there.\nJust chop those up real quick, and I'm just gonna make a quick side dish.\nHey, could you just grab me a plate over there?\nNick: You're gonna keep bossing me around and.\nNeo: Put it right there. Just rest that for, like, five ish minutes.\nThat'd be pretty good. Bring those potatoes over right about here.\nOkay. And I'll just grab them.\nAll right. I'm just gonna add a couple into the pan here.\nCan I have the asparagus now, please?\nNick: Listen. This is it.\nI'm not helping you anymore. I need to make my chimichurri.\nNow, I'm gonna go in with a bit of olive oil and a nice splash of white wine vinegar.\nThen some garlic. Fresh parsley.\nWhoosh! Whoa! Just a touch of paprika.\nA few red pepper flakes.\nA bit of garlic powder, a touch of salt, a good amount of fresh cracked pepper.\nAnd last but not least, my secret ingredient.\nNeo: I'm listening. Nick: A few pistachios.\nYou see what you're up against right now?\nNeo: Yeah, that's. That's advanced stuff.\nNick: Here we go. You want to taste.\nNeo: That's real funny, Nick. Let's just cut the steaks.\nNick: Congratulations, Neo.\nWe've finished cooking both of our steaks.\nThe question now is, whose do we cut into first?\nI think we.\nNeo: Got to definitely go with yours.\nNick: The pressure is on for both of us.\nThat's right. I'm gonna cut right in the middle.\nI'm gonna give you a sneak peak first.\nWhat do you think?\nNeo: Not too shabby.\nNick: You're gonna be honest with me. Are you nervous?\nNeo: I'm a little nervous. It is my first time cooking a steak.\nMoment of.\nNick: Truth. Okay. Three.\nTwo. One.\nLook at that. As much as I hate to admit it, it looks like Neo also got a perfect medium\nrare. Before you all vote in the comments below.\nWho won this challenge?\nI won the first level.\nThen the robots won round two with that amazing spaghetti puttanesca.\nSo it all comes down to this level three. Neo,\nWhy don't you explain your dish first?\nNeo: So I prepared for you a filet mignon.\nPerfect. Medium rare.\nAnd as you can see, we have these beautiful potatoes as well as some perfectly seared\nasparagus.\nNick: I will admit, yours actually looks pretty good, but what I have here is a more\nflavorful ribeye cooked perfectly medium, which is my personal favorite.\nYou and I can agree to disagree on that one.\nNeo: You're just wrong.\nNick: And under it, I've made a pistachio chimichurri and topped it off with a few\nextra parsley leaves.\nNeo: Don't let the parsley leaves fool you.\nThey don't really do much.\nNick: All right, guys.\nSo you've seen everything you need to see.\nSo make sure you go subscribe.\nAnd then go down to the comments below and say who you think won.\nNeo. Any last words?\nNeo: Let's face it, robots are way cooler in every single way possible.\n",
