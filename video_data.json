        "Recently i have seen so many Youtubers travelling to India. The thing that puts you and Chris out of the league is the fact that you don't travel to different parts of India with prejudices. You have an open mind to the experience with minimal expectations which kind of like leaves a positive impact on the audiences. Meanwhile a few youtubers from South Korea were super prejudiced and narrow minded throughout the series of vlogs. Kudos to you And Chris. ❤❤❤ Much love and support.",

        "Oh man! Kumar Samose Wala was just near my college. I always used to wonder why no vlogger visits it, that shop is so unique. It was our hanging spot during college days including other places in Moti Nagar and Kirti Nagar. So glad you visited there. I wish I could meet you somewhere in Delhi. \nAlso, a suggestion - > Must try \"KAKE DI HATTI's Naan\" in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi. Adjacent to it, is the original Giani's Faluda. It is a super delicious combination. The Aloo Naan at Kake's is just so damn yummy.",
