    "transcript": "have you ever seen a restaurant with no\nreviews it's weird it's strange I don't\nlike it most of these restaurants are\nfood trucks or perhaps small businesses\ninside of gas stations or grocery stores\nwaiting patiently to be reviewed that's\nwhere I come in I'm going to restaurants\nin my city that literally have zero\nratings they could be incredible they\ncould be horrible and it's all up to me\nto decide and for the absolute best\nrestaurant in my city I got this plaque\nmade basically it just says Ryan's\nfavorite restaurant in Austin Texas that\npreviously had no reviews up until Ryan\nreviewed it now that you know what's at\nstake in this video Let's eat starting\nwith Crispy Crunchy chicken I know what\nyou're thinking Ryan you're at a gas\nstation I know Crispy Crunchy chicken is\nsomewhere in this building behind me\nthere's absolutely no signage there's no\nindications that there's actually a\nchicken joint inside this building but\napparently there are almost 3,000 Crispy\nCrunchy chickens in\nAmerica where where are they yes this\nrestaurant has zero reviews but it has\nsome of the best social media posts I've\never seen when you and your bro both go\nfor the last Wing so true they have many\nother great posts but the point is\ninside this gas station could easily be\nthe best chicken I have ever had in my\nlife I've got my clipboard I've got my\nplaque oh I need to grab a pen if I want\nthem to take me seriously one\n[Music]\nsec okay what are we waiting for let's\ngo write the first review for Crispy\nCrunchy\nchicken I walk into Starfield market and\nnow I'm just kind of confused I don't\nsee Crispy Crunchy chicken anywhere is\nthis some sort of joke the good news is\nthey have a great selection of snacks\nand oil for cars and finally I don't\nknow how I didn't realize this but\nCrispy Crunchy chicken is actually\nlocated at Taco basket takaria a this\nplace is quaint I like it here there's\nan extensive menu we're talking tacos\nand chicken and more no pizza don't even\nthink about it so I guess the only thing\nleft to do is find out if the chicken is\nreally crispy and crunchy here how you\ndoing good how's it going good uh what\nwould you recommend for from Crispy\nCrunchy chicken chicken tenders very\ndelicious the chicken tenders yeah\nwhatever you would recommend the chicken\nchicken tenders and wedges okay what did\nyou working oh I I don't have a job yet\nbut just reviewing food and stuff trying\nto review different restaurants\nyeah we have successfully acquired\nCrispy Crunchy chicken okay all right\nthank you that actually means a lot\nbefore we open up the Chicken Box my\nexperience inside was pretty awesome\nfirst of all I just love gas stations I\nlove going to get fun drinks snacks it's\na fun way to break up your day so if\nthis food is top-notch the convenience\nis off the charts however convenience\ncomes with a price tag there's nowhere\nto sit there's no seating area that's\nunderstandable it's like a grab andg go\ntype of service the employees were so\nnice I had all kinds of questions of\nwhat kind of meal I should get and I was\ntreated with nothing but kindness so\nthat's a star right there just for\nservice but at the end of the day\nrestaurants come down to food so let's\nopen this box up first impressions love\nThe Branding I open it up and what do I\nsee a golden fried Symphony this meal is\n$9.19 you get ketchup their original\nsauce potato wedges I can't control\nmyself so I took a bite it's a good\npotato wedge some sort of Honey biscuit\nand of course the chicken strips without\nfurther Ado let's get\ncrunchy pretty much exactly what I would\nwant if I went to a place called Crispy\nCrunchy chicken the chicken's crispy\nit's crunchy it's got flavor a little\nbit of spice not too much spice because\nI can't handle anything beyond ketchup\nmost of the time just because of the\nsheer accuracy of the name of the\nrestaurant that's a star that's a star\nright there\n[Music]\nGoosebumps I have Goosebumps all over my\nbody sheerly after taking a bite of a\nbiscuit hang it in the Lou that's a star\nI don't really know what that expression\nmeans I think that's like uh where the\nMona Lisa is the Ambiance of large\n18-wheelers just sort of driving around\nis\nawesome my expectations have been blown\naway okay frankly I feel honored to be\nwriting this first review let's do it\nlet's let's write it I started writing\nmy review and you know what happened I\nthought I'm going to way more\nrestaurants in this video and my goal is\nto find the best of the best in my city\nto win my plaque I mean this this black\nmeans a lot to me I got it custom made\nso I thought to myself there must be a\nbigger story here so I found some locals\nand interviewed them well the crazy\nthing is they don't even have a sign out\nfront so how would you even know what in\nthere that's right I didn't even know it\nwas in there I've got enough information\nhere to finish writing my\n[Music]\nreview next up Momos euros and curries\nI'm noticing a theme with the\nrestaurants that don't have reviews they\ndon't have a sign in fact I'm not even\ncertain that it's even here all I see\nare Nails For You crafts and more and\nfresh deli but if it is here here I\nalready love Momos first of all the name\nis Momos that's awesome second of all\ntheir website is perfect they're clearly\nusing a free e-commerce template for\nrestaurants how do I know because the\nwebsite says get started with this free\ne-commerce template for restaurants\nright off the bat Momo is an economical\nbusiness Mogul I love the pictures on\nthe website I know exactly what I'm\ngetting myself into um okay now I'm\nconfused as you scroll down the menu it\nslowly goes from Mediterranean food to\nIndian food to Chinese food to Mexican\nfood and finally to chicken strips all\nroads lead back to me eating chicken\nstrips that's what I've discovered in my\nlife anyways it looks like I'm going to\nhave an excellent selection of choices\nhere at Momo's euros and curries but the\nreal test is waiting for me\ninside let's do this I I I don't know I\nfelt like I should have had a different\nfinal line all right I'm walking up to\nyet another gas station looking for a\nsign that this place actually exists and\nwhat do I see a Momo menu plastered on\nthe outside window Momos\nit's in there I think what a\nmenu like the other gas station this one\nhas a great selection of Beverages and\nsnacks and after looking in every corner\nof this gas station I decided this is\nprobably Momo there's a table here\nthat's crazy is this\nMomos okay can I sit okay awesome um is\nit just me or is a sit down restaurant\ninside of a convenience store kind of\nawesome that's a star all right okay all\nright calm down guys anyways I look\nthrough the menu and I know what I want\nto order can I try the chicken Momos um\nchicken masala do you have chicken\nstrips oh yeah yeah yeah so those three\nchicken Momos chicken masala chicken\nstrips it's actually really weird going\nto a restaurant with no reviews because\nyou can't see photos of people's\nexperience you can't see what people\nthink about the place so there's a real\nchance that this is about to be the best\nfood I've ever eaten in my life or I\ncould die I just felt like I don't know\nI just feel like raising the stakes of\nthe segment I I mean realistically I'm\nprobably going to be fine but yeah\nhopefully that was cool I ordered a lot\nof food most of which is probably going\nto be made from scratch so I started a\nstopwatch to see how long it's going to\ntake and while I was waiting I saw the\nowner and asked to interview her about\nMomos so this is Cash hi do you want to\nintroduce yourself my name is Cas I'm\nfrom Nepal and we just started like it's\nalmost 1 month so it's brand new yeah\nwhat's your first month been like it's\nreally hard yeah it's getting started\nit's a little bit slow mhm yeah very\nslow can you explain what Momos is when\nI came first here in USA I miss our food\na lot try to make like tast like from\nNepal and I try and try finally I got\nthe same taste from Nepal so my husband\nlike most M my m so we think like we can\ndo our business on this too I came back\nin with a new found appreciation for\nwhat I'm about to eat I can only imagine\nhow hard it is to start a restaurant so\nI am taking this first review very\nseriously awesome thank you you so much\nthank you Momos has been delivered I did\nhave a really big order I got pretty\nmuch three Entre I just couldn't pick\nthey all looked really good I will say\nright off the bat that just having a\nplace to sit is a huge win the last gas\nstation at Crispy Crunchy chicken had\nnothing of the sort so let's see what's\ninside we have a bed of rice Momo's\nchicken dumplings chicken masala and\nthese must be the chicken strips I think\nwe can all agree I'm going to have some\nleftovers can we add a laugh trap\nno why\nnot\nokay momo you have outdone yourself are\nyou seeing how good these look these\nlook like the most fresh dumplings I\nthink I've ever seen I'm very excited to\ntry everything else but these are\ncalling my name let's give it a shot\ncheers these look really hot I hope it\ndoesn't burn\nmy\nwow that is insane M the texture is\namazing the flavor just pops holy moly\nthat dumpling alone is a star I had the\nmindset coming in to review these\nrestaurants said I was going to be a\ntough critic but this food completely\nmade me forget about any of that because\nI was just grateful to be eating it next\nup we've got the chicken masala you can\nliterally see with your eyes that it\ntastes good the flavor is visible this\nis one of Haley's favorite foods so I\neat it a lot definitely think I'm going\nto have to bring some home however I\ndon't want to speak too soon let's\nactually eat\nit I am not exaggerating when I say I\nneed to ask this man for his name so I\ncan thank him personally I'm bringing\nthe rest of the chicken masala home to\nHaley that's going to get me some\nbrownie points am I right boys lastly we\nhave chicken strips I got the chicken\nstrips honestly as a backup the\ndumplings and the chicken masala blew me\naway so this might just be one of those\nthings where someone's coming in they\nwant a quick chicken strip it's a solid\nchicken strip it's not going to add a\nstar to my review but it's pretty much\neverything you could ask for\nso I packed up my leftovers brought them\nhome to Haley and this is my review for\n[Music]\nMomos next up Kika sushi I'm as confused\nas you are the last restaurant was in a\ngas station and this one is in a grocery\nstore I don't know about you but I'm\nstarting to see a trend I took off my\nsuit jacket because I was sweating\nprofusely I'm about to eat dinner at\nKika Sushi Whole Foods gets thousands\nmaybe millions of customers every day\nbut do they even know that Kika Sushi\nexists let's go see if it\ndoes pretty\ncool I walked into Whole Foods and I\ndon't even know where to start looking\nfor Kika sushi so I decided to interview\nsome locals have you heard of Kika Sushi\nno I haven't have you heard of Kika\nSushi I have not have you guys heard of\nKika Sushi no no no okay excuse me have\nyou heard of Kika Sushi K Sushi Yes\nactually just when I thought all hope\nwas lost an amazing Whole Foods employee\nescorted me all the way to Kika sushi so\nthis is Kika Sushi they have tons of\nsushi which I I probably should have\nexpected but I'm easily impressed they\nalso have a fun menu with a variety of\nrice bowls I think a big reason that\npeople might not know it really exists\nis because it doesn't even have the name\nKika Sushi anywhere but it looks\ndelicious so let's give it a shot can I\nget S\nTeriyaki white r please yes thank you\nwhile I was waiting for my order I\nlooked around the produce area a bit and\nfound an\n[Music]\napple oh awesome cheers thank you I'm\ntrying to figure out how to pay for this\nbut also how many restaurants are in\nthis grocery store that don't have any\nreviews The eery Next Level Burger juice\nland I don't think this is considered a\nrestaurant but still I went to self\ncheckout and got my teriyaki bowl for\n$15.49 very expensive but maybe it'll be\nworth it Whole Foods has these utensil\ndispensers I mean come on that was\nawesome okay let's\n[Music]\neat Bona Whole Foods has this nice\nseating area outside so nice to eat at a\ntable just barely beats eating on that\nsidewalk outside of Crispy Crunchy\nchicken this meal looks beautiful it was\npricey but it looks like really high\nquality ingredients it's hard not to\nfeel like I'm reviewing Whole Foods\nbecause I got this Apple from the\nproduce section am I going to eat it as\npart of my Kika Sushi\nexperience honey crisp is the best apple\nwhat do you what do you want me to\ndo okay I finished my appetizer let's\ntry out this salmon teriyaki bowl from\nKika sushi so what we're looking at here\nis a Teriyaki glazed grilled salmon\ntopped with sesame seeds which is super\nduper yummy the bowl also comes with\nwhite rice soaked in Teriyaki oops sorry\ny I'm pretty uncoordinated and it is\nalso really good yeah I don't know what\nthis is is it is it Lettuce I don't eat\nvegetables I'm going to do it I'm going\nto\ntry one day I'll grow up I enjoy the\nrest of my meal basking in the sun\ndodging vegetables and honestly it was a\ngreat time I really enjoyed this after I\nfinished my meal though I remembered\nwhat was at stake here and I knew I had\nto get to writing I have a large variety\nof weird pens here's my review\nnext up El Gran aaho Mexican and Italian\ncuisine we made it I love Italian\ncuisine and I love Mexican Cuisine so\nwe're off to a great start this\nrestaurant is directly off of a highway\nso that's awesome but what does el gron\naaho translate into the great Royal\nwelcome oh that's a big promise we'll\nsee what kind of welcome I receive upon\nentry I don't know how I feel about the\nsuit I don't mean to change the subject\nI'm just getting really worried that I'm\nmaking a scene by wearing this\neverywhere right off the bat one thing I\nwill give this restaurant purely by\nexamining it from the outside Vibes The\nVibes are off the charts I mean this is\nthe type of place you come on the\nweekend with your friends and just\ngrub their website domain has\nunfortunately expired it's currently up\nfor auction there's not much information\nabout this place online but whoever is\nrunning their social media accounts\nneeds a raise because they're hustling\nharder than I even am on my own Joy Ride\naccount I mean that's just great content\nhow do they even do that effect I I'm\nnot familiar with that effect anyways\nI'm not just standing here to sweat in a\nsuit and listen to AM in traffic noises\nthat will probably cause hearing damage\nlong term let's go get a meal and a\nroyal\nwelcome oh it's\n[Music]\nclosed K Cafe I wonder what that means\nthe suit was fun while it lasted I know\nbut instead of this restaurant taking me\nseriously I want them to take me for\ngranted no that's not what I meant\nhonestly I don't like people thinking\nthat I just got out of court I just want\nto enjoy my meal the restaurant in\nquestion is K Cafe so naturally I'm like\noh looks cute I what does K mean I look\nit up on Google and apparently K is the\nsound of males trying to attract females\nand repel other males during mating\nseason this whole shopping center is a\nlittle confusing I see two and maybe\nthree food trucks including tastea\nIsland it's tempting not to go there but\nI'm staying focused on K Cafe here's a\nmap view of the whole place I'm standing\nright here this restaurant is really\nclose to Target which is nice because I\nactually had to go to Target really bad\nI walked in ran into my boy Lewis we\nwent to college together I walked into\nthe candy aisle and what do I see a\nbunch of candy sitting right next to Joy\nRide if you don't know by now Joy Ride\nis my candy brand and my dream is to\nmake it the top selling candy in Target\neven though we don't use any fake colors\nor junk ingredients so far we've\nactually ranked in the top five selling\ncandies but to beat the final four we're\ngoing to need all of you guys so if you\ndon't live in America just follow Joy\nRide on Instagram that would help so\nmuch but if you do live in America go to\nTarget get some Joy Ride scan the QR\ncode on the back upload your receipt\nbecause over the next 2 months I'm going\nto be picking five lucky winners to\nreceive these new rare Joy Ride candies\nand I'm even going to be hand delivering\none of the boxes to you guys so join the\nclimb and let's get joy right to the\nnumber one selling candy in Target so we\ncan change the world of candy so now\nthat I've got my dessert let's go write\nthe first review at K\nCafe First Impressions K Cafe kind of a\nVibe hello how's it going good I'll do\nthe coffee with milk and I'll just have\nwaffles is there anything else you\nrecommend I mean there's a breakfast\nokay I'll do that with uh eggs and bacon\nanything else that's going to be it guys\nI ordered a coffee they have a coffee\nbar with all kinds of condiments for\ntheir guests including hot sauce I\nimmediately got distracted by this\ninfomercial that was playing on\nliterally max\nvolume but somehow I found a way to\nfinish preparing my coffee it's actually\ndelicious like really really good that's\na star and while waiting for my food to\ncome I walked over to this Lounge area\nsuper cozy that's a star I'm here with\nNelis Nelis this is my first time here\nis this your family that runs a\nrestaurant yes no way that's awesome\nwhat's uh one goal that you guys have\njust as a family and as a restaurant I\nmean to just make people happy and fill\nup their stomachs and make them enjoy\nthe food I love it I've got a nice plate\nhere of tater tots bacon eggs and\ntoast the coffee is actually so good\nalso I'm sorry if there's a lot of\nbackground noise our options were either\nsitting right next to the TV that's\nconstantly playing infomercials or the\nfan that's on max speed I decided to sit\nnext to the fan tater tot\ntax and they're really good I was about\nto start eating my classic American\nbreakfast but then I realized my waffles\nhad arrived I didn't notice my waffles\narrive when did they get there I didn't\neven hear her set that down that's crazy\nguys I'm so locked in filming these\nYouTube videos smash like And subscribe\nplease I don't know first I tried the\nbacon I love bacon so this was good next\nI tried the eggs pretty standard but\nthat's just how I like them next it was\ntime to get into this bread it broke\napart beautifully and it tasted amazing\nfinally I poured some syrup onto the\nwaffle sliced it apart and gave it a\nbite literally after one bite of that\nwaffle and I'm ready to hang this plaque\nup right here and I'm just kidding they\nprobably wouldn't be happy about that I\nI mean it's one of the best waffles I've\nhad in a long time that's all I'm trying\nto say all right well Ki Cafe is\nactually closing my meal was delicious I\nlove K Cafe there I said it I think that\nwearing a suit made me a little bit less\nintimidating I'm pretty naturally\nintimidating as it is just the way that\nI normally am every day a lot of people\nkind of just scared of me the way that I\nlook anyways let's write this review\nnext up is this barbecue place all right\nhere we are Perez barbecue I'm in the\ncutest small town of all time look at\nthis downtown Street and look at this\nlight pole donated by Roy Gill that's\nthe type of thing you see in small towns\nFirst Impressions I love everything\nabout this barbecue stand first of all\nit's only open on the weekends news\nflash it's the weekend yeah I like to do\nmy research when I film videos looks\nlike they've got a smoker currently\nsmoking Meats pretty nice there's also a\nseating area some historic pieces like\nthis train car all pretty fun from what\nI can tell Perez barbecue mostly gets\nthe word out via Facebook posts like\njust lots and lots of Facebook posts\nthat and a slogan stay in shirts since\nthe80s good thing I'm not wearing\nwhite I've made a dire mistake based on\nthat slogan they've been in business for\n45 years and they've never gotten a\nsingle review that's either a really\ngood thing or everyone who's ever eaten\nhere has died the point is I'm going to\nbreak a 45 year long drought if I\nsurvive let's go grab some food\n[Music]\nhello how's sir good good you guys have\neverything still yeah risked ribs\nchicken sausage awesome all right it's\nbeen an our family for about 40 years\nnow start off that little spot wow can I\njust get a/4 lb of chicken brisket ribs\nand sausage all right I am so excited to\neat barbecue they got out the brisket it\nlooks amazing it looks so good and don't\neven get me started on those\nribs barbecue secured this was $25 but\nthere's so much food in here so I'm\nexcited to eat this however first I\nfound a local to\ninterview here we go\nready I'm here with Anthony Capo and\nChip this is chip Chips a rescue\nChihuahua I love rescue Chihuahua I've\ngot one of my own okay Anthony what can\nyou tell me about Perez barbecue before\nI dig in well I have to sneak off every\nSaturday and come and get some from work\nor from my house it's literally the best\nbarbecue I know so you grew up around\nhere can you give me any backstory about\nPerez they've been around since I was a\nbaby kind of went away for a little a\nlittle bit there and the town was in a\ndeep depression but once they came back\nliterally everybody always comes every\nSaturday Anthony's a Cowboys fan I'm a\nTexans fan but we can sit at the same\ntable and pet chip together yes\nabsolutely chip do you have anything to\nsay about\nbarbecue this is the best dog I've ever\nseen all right we got to we got to take\na bite together Bottoms Up would a toast\nbe awkward no that's cool just like I\nremember from a week ago that is so good\nthat's crazy what would you rate this\nplace thousand out of a five\nall right Anthony so nice to meet you\nthank you so much thank you guys that's\nthe most chill Chihuahua I think I've\nseen in a long time I know he can't read\nbut can we all just Spam we love you\nchip in the comments it's got to mean\nsomething to him finally it's time to\neat the sausage was unbelievable that\n100% earned a star right there chip\nmight have just bumped the rating up\neven higher as well the meal doesn't\ncome with utensils because most people\njust pick it up and go home but they did\ngive me a spooky plate with free bread\nto make a sandwich and that is service\nokay I'm going to eat this now as I'm\ntaking these bites of barbecue and\ndesperately trying to avoid getting\nstains on my white clothing I'm having\nthis realization that I never try new\nrestaurants I pretty much only eat at\nChipotle and McDonald's meanwhile there\nare restaurants in my area serving some\nof the best food I've ever had in my\nlife and I don't even know about it not\nto be dramatic but I think this video is\nchanging my life anyways here's my\n[Music]\nreview it has been 2 weeks since I last\nrecorded for this video I have been\ngoing back and forth in my mind of who\ndeserves this plaque as the best\nrestaurant with no reviews I ate so much\ngood food throughout this video I met so\nmany awesome people it's not an easy\ndecision but I have come to the\nconclusion that there is one restaurant\nthat is simply Untouchable it is the\nbest it deserves the world the food is\nincredible the people are amazing I\nbelieve in it I want it to succeed and\nthis plaque represents that so not only\nam I going to go in there and surprise\nthem with this plaque but they said that\ntheir biggest struggle is getting new\ncustomers because they just opened and\nit's hard to get word out so I brought a\nbunch of friends and at the end of this\nvideo I'm going to put their address so\nwithout further Ado let's go surprise\nMomos I asked a bunch of my friends to\ncome to a gas station 25 minutes outside\nof the city but I promise them that when\nthey try the food it's going to be so\nworth it so cash I've been going through\nall of Austin trying to find the best\nrestaurant with no reviews and Momo's by\nfar and way is absolutely the best\nrestaurant in Austin so we got you this\ncake because I'm leaving a five star\nreview thank you so much yes make a wish\nsh how about we eat some\nfood we ordered so much food we got\nchicken Momos chicken masala and the\ncombination Euros all of the food was\namazing everyone was shocked that this\nrestaurant previously had no reviews I\nasked everyone to describe the food in\none word listen to this it's incredible\nfantastic busing yummy drippy Immaculate\ngas slim delectable yummy just delicious\nnow that we're all stuffed and everyone\nagrees that Momos is amazing I just had\none last thing to do\ndo guys if you live in the Austin area\nplease go try Momos take a photo with\nthe plaque and tag me also thank you to\neveryone who's been going to Target and\ngetting Joy Ride let's keep the climb\ngoing and finally YouTube thinks you'll\nlove this video on the screen right now\nso just give it a click give it a
